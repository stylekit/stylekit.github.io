SPM + XCode tutorial<!--more--> 

## Prextext:
Here is how you use SPM in your app projects. SPM -> Swift package manager 

## The workflow:  

1. Terminal: ``cd ~/dev/MyProject/`` 👈 navigate to your project
2. Terminal: ``swift package init`` 👈 creates the initial SPM files  
3. Add the bellow to your newly created Package.swift file: 
```swift
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "MyProject",
	dependencies: [
		.Package(url: "https://github.com/eonist/swift-utils.git", Version(0, 0, 0, prereleaseIdentifiers: ["alpha", "3"]))
    ]
)
```
👆 basically adds Swift-utils as a third Party framework in your project  

4. Terminal: ``swift build`` 👈 downloads the dependencies from github and builds binaries (aka .framework)  
5. Terminal: ``swift package generate-xcodeproj`` 👈  Creates an XCode project that has .framework files
6. XCode: Open the .xcodeproj file file -> Target -> Cocoa app
7. XCode: Add this: add ``@testable import Utils`` to ``AppDelegate.swift`` and ``print(StringParser.sansSuffix("blue"))`` inside the ``applicationDidFinishLaunching`` method
8. ``cmd + r`` will now print ``blu``

## Why is this pure awesomeness?

1. When you develop your app. You use binaries but you have full access to third-party code. 🔑🔑🔑  
2. When you need to download a new version of third party libs: Terminal: ``swift package update`` 👌👌👌  
3. Supports nested frameworks 👈 holy grail of Dependency management ❤️💙️💚	 
4. Supports CI untested but check 🤖🤖🤖   [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/apple-swift-package-manager-deep-dive-shashikant-jagtap) 
5. If you are developing on your own third-party modules you can integrate this workflow with no extra steps. as the packages are pure .git projects. Just commit back to github repo from your project. 🎉🎉🎉   
6. If you add code to third-party dependencies then they are embedded in the binaries automatically. 👊👊👊   

## Todo:  
- [ ] Investigate ``buildMetadataIdentifier`` 👈 Supposedly it enables you to target single commit ids
