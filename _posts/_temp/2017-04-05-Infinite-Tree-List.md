```swift
//Then you start designing Infinite treeList
    //differentiate indentation via css-classifier
        //you prob need classId for this, but use element-id for first interpolation
    //when you open an item, you basically insert items into a flatList
        //you set the css-classifer to the correct indentation 
    //when you hide children, you basically remove items from a flatList
    
    
//Basically you could Just use FastList with a treeList DP. 
    //if you click on an item open/close icon, you change the dp. and the dp changes FastList
    //The TreeListDP will set the indentation by changing the css-selector
