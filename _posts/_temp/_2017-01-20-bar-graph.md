### Discussion:
Ideally it would be best to have a center of gravity at 0 and then have additions shoot upwards and deletions shoot downwards. However it requires one to handle cases where there is no deletions for instance. And also should the up/down max value be uniform or? A simpler approach is to just account for additions. Simple design that is very similar to how the Graph is setup. 


### 5 vertical indicators (amount of addition deletions)

similar design as Graph (0,1,2,3,4,5,6)

### 7 Horizontal indicators (days per week)

m,t,w,t,f,s,s

Horizontal Gradient colors or?

### How do you handle values that are 0?

basically if a time-unit has value, you render the bar. If its lower than a circle height, then render circle hight. 
Just clamp the height applied to the bar with a min and max value before you render it. 


### Gestures: 

Handle gestures just like you did in the GitSyncGraph. But also add a debug layer that shows the points of touch. Similar to how Framer does it. 

- This feature needs research. 
- How do you find coordinates to touch points, how do you then position these relative to the NSView. 
- Might need some ratio calculations to get the right look and feel.
