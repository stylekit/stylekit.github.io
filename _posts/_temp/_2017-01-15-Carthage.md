My notes on Carthage<!--more--> 

## First Impression:

## Concept:

Carthage doesn’t really do anything magic; you’re always in control. You manually add dependencies to your Xcode project and Carthage fetches and builds them.

## Using carthage:
```bash
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" == 2.0
github "SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON" ~> 2.3.0
```
These two lines tell Carthage that your project requires Alamofire version 2.0, and the latest version of SwiftyJSON that’s compatible with version 2.3.0.


## Dependency Versioning:

Dependency Version: This is how you tell Carthage which version of a dependency you’d like to use. There are a number of options at your disposal, depending on how specific you want to be:
1. == 1.0 means “Use exactly version 1.0”  
2. >= 1.0 means “Use version 1.0 or higher”  
3. ~> 1.0 means “Use any version that’s compatible with 1.0″, essentially meaning any version up until the next major release.
If you specify ~> 1.7.5, then any version from 1.7.5 up to, but not including 2.0, is considered compatible.  
Likewise, if you specify ~> 2.0 then Carthage will use a version 2.0 or later, but less than 3.0. .
Compatibility is based on Semantic Versioning – for more information check out our tutorial on Using CocoaPods with Swift.
## Uninstalling Carthage

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/CarthageKit.framework
rm -f /usr/local/bin/carthage
```


## Installing Carthage:

Inatalling carthage 0.18.1 was a bit tricky. It worked flawlessly on my mac mini server but not so much on my macbook pro. 
After installing Carthage from the .pkg file. Terminal would not find carthage. So in order to make it work i had to hunt down the path where Carthage resided: ```` and then figure out how to make an Alias in terminal. 

1. In terminal type: ``nano .bash_profile``  
2. Then add this ``alias carthage="sudo /usr/local/bin/carthage"``  
3. ``ctrl + o``` and then ``enter`` and then ``ctrl x`` Restart terminal  
4. type carthage version in terminal and you will be promted to type in your password. 
5. That drawback is that you have to type your password every time you want to use carthage.
