My preliminary notes on AppCode<!--more--> 


## Pros: ✅
- AppCode can rename symbolically 🏆. Meaning it can rename a function and globally change every reference in your entire codebase to the new name. This is worth the price of admission alone
- AppCode edits your xcode .xcodeproject file when moving files. Everything is perfectly mirrored. This is worth its weight in gold alone. My projects are going to be so organized.
- Building an app works, .frameworks seems to work.
- MY entire complicated "Ultimate SPM workflow" worked out of the box just adding the project folder to AppCode
- It's fast. Unlike xcode
- Appcode asks permission to share app metrics annonomies. Its good that they ask and that its not hidden in some obscure setting. Happened on the 8th run or so. 

## Cons: 🚫
- It's Eclipse. It's java. 
- TextExpander doesn't work, will try to find a solution for this!
- XCode Tree-view collapses if you do something in AppCode. 
- Sometimes the AppCode icon jumps up and down with a green ✅ sign. I presume it's updated, but no info in the app 🤔
- Way too many preference options, which is often the case with Eclipse/java based apps. Less is more. Hide the advance stuff please. 80/20 rule? The prefs that are used a lot, highlight these then hide the prefs that isn't used much.
- you have to doubble click to open files from tree menu (possible changable in settings)
- AppCode feels like a futuristic code editor. 
- The symbolic renaming functionality doesn't always work (sometimes it doesn't catch all reference in the code base)

## Top AppCode key-combos 🏄

- Your personal AppCode concierge: (cmd + shift + A) it basically list all available commands and is searchable. When you dont want to searh helplessly through the gazillion pref options just try to free associate  about what you want to do and things may show up here. Like bigger font size, write increase font etc.
