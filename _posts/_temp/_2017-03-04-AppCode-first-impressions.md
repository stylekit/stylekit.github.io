My preliminary notes on AppCode<!--more--> 


## Pros:

- AppCode edits your xcode .xcodeproject file when moving files. Everything is perfectly mirrored. This is worth its weight in gold alone. My projects are going to be so organized.

- AppCode can rename symbolically 🏆. Meaning it can rename a function and globally change every reference in your entire codebase to the new name. 

- Building an app works, .frameworks seems to work.

- MY entire complicated "Ultimate SPM workflow" worked out of the box just adding the project folder to AppCode

## Cons: 
- It's Eclipse. It's java. 
- TextExpander doesn't work, will try to find a solution for this!
- XCode Tree-view collapses if you do something in AppCode. 
- Sometimes the AppCode icon jumps up and down with a green ✅ sign. I presume its updated, but no info in the app 🤔
- Way too many prefrence options, which is often the case with Eclipse/java based apps. Less is more. Hide the advance stuff please.
