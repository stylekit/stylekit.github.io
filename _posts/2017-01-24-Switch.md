### Shape:
```
//40px height, 70px width
//grey outline 2px
//dropShadow downwards
//bg fill white
```


### Transition to: (0-1)
```
//green outline 2px
//bg fill green
//dropShadow downwards
```


### Animation:

```
//on circle down : animate circle width 20% easeIn 0.2 sec (left if its in right pos, right if in left pos)
//when dragging: keep circle width at 120%

//for simplicity: transition from white to green based on volKnobProgress

//on switch up: easeIn 0.2 tween white<->green
//on switch up: easeIn 0.2 circle with current.width -> circle.height

//animate pos of switch to target end pos based on +-0.5 (left or right) easeIn 0.2

//mouse-up: within 50% and the state is the same -> tween to on state (and the same for the opposite condition)
	//possibly disable functionality while transitioning. 
```


### Inspiration:
Original IOS switch: https://github.com/cruffenach/CRToast
https://github.com/bvogelzang/SevenSwitch
real ios switch example: https://github.com/cruffenach/CRToast

### Original IOS switch behaviour analysis:

- The white fill in the Switch-background animates from the center until it covers the grey/green  
- The white fill tweens inwards when animating from green/grey to white  
- the grey green fill tweens very fast going from off<->on state  
- The grey/green outline needs to be outside or else the white will cover it  

- The thumb animates onUp and onDown 
- the thumb slightly bounces back if it is clicked as opposed to being dragged


### Todo:

- [x] Try to animate the thumb onUp onDown ✅
- [x] Animate the bg fill from white to grey on mouse-down ✅
- [x] onUpInside warrants state change off<->on✅
- [x] animate off<->on progress✅
- [x] animate w/ bounce (Use easeInBounce transition) ✅
- [x] onSlide -> +- 0.5 animates on/off state (slide does not directly change thumb.pos) ✅  
- [x] The bounceBack anim should apply to the thumb on progress = 0 or progress = 1 ✅  
- [x] Try to animate the bg fills (try to anim fillet, w, h) ✅
- [x] Try to setup bg fills that can iris animate (dilating-doors-style) ✅
- [ ] When dragging the interpolation of bg color should be grey to green 👈
- [ ] Adjust the line-thickness and overall size
- [ ] Make it easy to customize colors via css (pull colors from css)
- [ ] Refactor the code to make it simpler. 
- [ ] Consider not using HSlider and Button as baseClasses
- [ ] Create dedicated SwitchButton, SwitchSlider, SwitchCheckButton internal classes 
- [ ] The entire switch needs to act like a button
- [ ] Only scale the width of the bg to width - (height*2) or else it will dilate too fast
